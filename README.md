 1 Description About Project  
                 The Books Application is a simple application that allows users to manage their books. The application is built using Express for the backend (API) and Vue 3 for the frontend. The backend exposes an API to fetch books details, while the frontend displays and interacts with this data.
 2 Technologies Used
   Backend:

     Node.js
     Express.js
     Axios (for making HTTP requests from Vue)
     CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
  Frontend:

    Vue.js (Vue 3)
    Vue CLI
    Axios (for HTTP requests)
    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
 If you're running the frontend and backend on different ports (e.g., frontend on http://localhost:8080 and backend on http://localhost:3000), you might run into CORS issues. To resolve this, you can install and configure the cors package in your Express backend
 comment : npm install cors
 Running the Project Locally
